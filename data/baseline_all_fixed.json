He calls out songs and dance instructions and cracks his whip against the ground. Another dancer, sometimes a small boy, will represent El Toro (the bull), who initiates a bullfight with El Abuelo and is slain. This side battle symbolizes the battle between good and evil. The music is usually played with nonindigenous instruments like the violin and guitar. The costumes and masks of the dance are very important and are usually made by the dancers themselves or their families.", "passage_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chM.txt_n-r59", "passage_index": 2, "label": "option3", "justification": null, "question_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chM.txt_n-r59_plain_2_assignment87", "worker_id": "worker39", "validation_way": 10, "protocol": "baseline", "start_time": "2020-11-12T09:09:12.645148", "finish_time": "2020-11-12T09:14:15.490683", "delta_sec": 302, "delta_micro_sec": 845535, "option1": "French", "option2": "Latin", "option3": "Spanish", "option4": "Mandarin", "treatment": 0}

The other is the Sheriffs Labor Assistance Program (SLAP), which puts low-level criminals to work (for real!) cleaning up parks, painting public buildings, helping out in nursing homes, and more. \"Fail to do exactly what you're required to do on SLAP,\" Coburn declares, \"and you get slam--as in, see you in jail for sure.\"", "passage_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_1/journal/slate/36/ArticleIP_2409.txt_n-r16", "passage_index": 2, "label": "option3", "justification": null, "question_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_1/journal/slate/36/ArticleIP_2409.txt_n-r16_plain_2_assignment356", "worker_id": "worker61", "validation_way": 10, "protocol": "baseline", "start_time": "2020-11-11T18:13:05.831170", "finish_time": "2020-11-11T18:14:37.588512", "delta_sec": 91, "delta_micro_sec": 757342, "option1": "Labor assistance", "option2": "farm work", "option3": "probation", "option4": "part time work", "treatment": 0}

Slate 's David Edelstein says \"Entrapment is an A-list production, but despite ... a bevy of state-of-the-art sensors, cybergizmos, and digital readouts, it can't manage to brush off its B-movie cobwebs.\" (Read the rest of Edelstein's review .)", "passage_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_1/journal/slate/50/ArticleIP_27103.txt_n-r7", "passage_index": 2, "label": "option1", "justification": null, "question_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_1/journal/slate/50/ArticleIP_27103.txt_n-r7_plain_2_assignment444", "worker_id": "worker108", "validation_way": 10, "protocol": "baseline", "start_time": "2020-11-13T13:52:35.289254", "finish_time": "2020-11-13T14:03:13.677830", "delta_sec": 638, "delta_micro_sec": 388576, "option1": "Catherine Zeta-Jones", "option2": "Angelina Jolie  ", "option3": "Jennifer Connelly", "option4": "Sharon Stone", "treatment": 0}

Augusto Pinochet, who has been under house arrest in London since October 1998 when a Spanish judge requested his extradition to face charges there, took still more turns this weekend when the Spanish attorney general called on Britain to release Pinochet because the procedure has taken so long that it is no longer legal. Many Spaniards, including the judge who originally demanded Pinochet's extradition, protested the move. Swiss, French, and Belgian authorities have also asked that Pinochet be extradited to their jurisdictions, so it is possible that if the Spanish request is withdrawn, the proceedings will continue with one of those countries as the petitioner. Also, the conservative Sunday Telegraph of London reported, it is possible that Pinochet could face trial in Britain if Spain withdraws its request. In Spain, El Pa\u00eds reported that Chile has tried to persuade the United States to find an \"extrajudicial\" solution to the Pinochet problem, perhaps referring the matter to adjudication. A surprising editorial Monday in the conservative Spanish daily ABC came out against such a solution. \"It isn't a question of political ideology or of bilateral relations with a friendly country.

Augusto Pinochet, who has been under house arrest in London since October 1998 when a Spanish judge requested his extradition to face charges there, took still more turns this weekend when the Spanish attorney general called on Britain to release Pinochet because the procedure has taken so long that it is no longer legal. Many Spaniards, including the judge who originally demanded Pinochet's extradition, protested the move. Swiss, French, and Belgian authorities have also asked that Pinochet be extradited to their jurisdictions, so it is possible that if the Spanish request is withdrawn, the proceedings will continue with one of those countries as the petitioner. Also, the conservative Sunday Telegraph of London reported, it is possible that Pinochet could face trial in Britain if Spain withdraws its request. In Spain, El Pa\u00eds reported that Chile has tried to persuade the United States to find an \"extrajudicial\" solution to the Pinochet problem, perhaps referring the matter to adjudication. A surprising editorial Monday in the conservative Spanish daily ABC came out against such a solution. \"It isn't a question of political ideology or of bilateral relations with a friendly country. It's a question of what is or isn't right. Spain is a friend of Chile and this matter ... is having a negative effect on bilateral relations.

I suspect that spending many hours getting Reagan to talk about the past (which he is astute enough to realize does not mean much to Reagan except as the source of well-worn anecdotes) must have given him an exaggerated sense of Reagan's detachment from any engagement with the present. My view of Reagan's powers of leadership is perhaps different from yours. I agree with you that Reagan was a tremendously effective leader--partly because he was attractive and a good speaker; but even more because he was a man of absolute certitude about his core convictions and was able to convey a sense of assurance and self-confidence. Where did that certitude come from? One thing that Morris does convey pretty well, I think, is that Reagan formed convictions fairly early in his consideration of a question and that these convictions then became more or less impervious to challenge from evidence that might contradict them.

I suspect that spending many hours getting Reagan to talk about the past (which he is astute enough to realize does not mean much to Reagan except as the source of well-worn anecdotes) must have given him an exaggerated sense of Reagan's detachment from any engagement with the present. My view of Reagan's powers of leadership is perhaps different from yours. I agree with you that Reagan was a tremendously effective leader--partly because he was attractive and a good speaker; but even more because he was a man of absolute certitude about his core convictions and was able to convey a sense of assurance and self-confidence. Where did that certitude come from? One thing that Morris does convey pretty well, I think, is that Reagan formed convictions fairly early in his consideration of a question and that these convictions then became more or less impervious to challenge from evidence that might contradict them. That did not always make these convictions useful bases for policy or action, but they did make them extremely effective as vehicles for shaping opinion and attracting support.

Experts claim that there are many yet to be explored and charted, and perhaps the Crystal Cave system might itself have been left undiscovered were it not for a quirk of fate. In 1907, two young boys were playing cricket, and after a particularly good stroke they lost the ball down a small sinkhole. They decided to try to retrieve the ball and, with ropes and lanterns, they entered the hole and discovered a magical landscape 37 m (120 ft) underground. They never did find their cricket ball, but when you enter the caves you will understand why they became distracted from their original purpose. The caves have cathedral-like dimensions, with hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites hundreds of thousands of years old. The stalactites grow at a rate of 1 cm (about a half inch) every 100 years, so it is easy to begin to estimate the age of the largest structures.

From here it is only a five-minute walk to Crystal Caves. The unique geological conditions that formed Bermuda created a number of cave systems. Experts claim that there are many yet to be explored and charted, and perhaps the Crystal Cave system might itself have been left undiscovered were it not for a quirk of fate. In 1907, two young boys were playing cricket, and after a particularly good stroke they lost the ball down a small sinkhole. They decided to try to retrieve the ball and, with ropes and lanterns, they entered the hole and discovered a magical landscape 37 m (120 ft) underground. They never did find their cricket ball, but when you enter the caves you will understand why they became distracted from their original purpose. The caves have cathedral-like dimensions, with hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites hundreds of thousands of years old. The stalactites grow at a rate of 1 cm (about a half inch) every 100 years, so it is easy to begin to estimate the age of the largest structures. A clear tidal lake sits at the bottom of the cave, spanned by a pontoon bridge so you can explore the interior.

The relatively recent term stealth candidate has had two meanings. One refers simply to a candidate who seems not to show up on the political radar screen--George Bush used the term this way in speaking of his opponent, Michael Dukakis, in 1988.

Knowing this, New York dealer Jeffrey Deitch suggested the title for the Brooklyn exhibition. Bacon cited Val\u00e9ry to mean precisely that modern art, including realist art like his own, could do without narrative, without literary values.

What's true of the lottery should be true at the racetrack. And gambling consultant Maury Wolff confirms that if you're designing a complicated bet like a trifecta, the way to generate the most action per dollar's worth of prize money (and hence the most profit for the track) is to offer very large prizes at very long odds. Why, then, do the tracks continue to offer bets with much smaller payoffs? According to Wolff, it's because big prize winners take their money and go home while small prize winners plow their winnings back into the next race.

What's true of the lottery should be true at the racetrack. And gambling consultant Maury Wolff confirms that if you're designing a complicated bet like a trifecta, the way to generate the most action per dollar's worth of prize money (and hence the most profit for the track) is to offer very large prizes at very long odds. Why, then, do the tracks continue to offer bets with much smaller payoffs? According to Wolff, it's because big prize winners take their money and go home while small prize winners plow their winnings back into the next race.

Six km (4 miles) from Playa Morena is the entrance to the San Gervasio Archaeological Park. The remains of San Gervasio are located several kilometers from the site entrance, and though not on the scale of the major Mayan settlements of the mainland, the beautiful tropical park environment makes the ruins worth exploring. Most structures date from the post-classical period (1200\u20131650); the site was still in use when the Spanish arrived. At the Estructura Manitas (Little Hands Structure), you can clearly see the red handprints, dating from around 1000, on the inside wall of the temple. From here you can walk the route of a short sacred sacb\u00e9 (Mayan road) to the central collection of small buildings.

When you look at the early American modernists such as Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, John Marin, and Joseph Stella, you see inventive and delightful things. But you can't compare these guys to their European contemporaries, such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, Amedeo Modigliani, Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Wassily Kandinsky, or Kasimir Malevich. Or maybe you can, but the Whitney doesn't try. It is content to examine the American modernists in relation to their far less interesting domestic contemporaries and a broad cultural context that seems mostly irrelevant to their work.

It's no wonder Altman fell on it. As early as M*A*S*H (1970), the director seemed more taken with the ebb and flow of groups than with the isolated treks of individuals. It's not just that he likes to tell stories with multiple strands, or that he gets bored easily with one consciousness, or even that he cherishes some '60s utopian fantasy of the collective. What Cookie's Fortune suggests is that for Altman order in the universe can't be discerned in the comings and goings of lone heroes but in the interactions among vast and disparate collections of people. This time out, he transforms the bad vibes of his other films into a vision that's positively serene.

But it sure feels that way. The screenwriter, Anne Rapp, has provided Altman with a blueprint not only for an ensemble comedy but also for a comedy that honors the very idea of an ensemble. It's no wonder Altman fell on it. As early as M*A*S*H (1970), the director seemed more taken with the ebb and flow of groups than with the isolated treks of individuals. It's not just that he likes to tell stories with multiple strands, or that he gets bored easily with one consciousness, or even that he cherishes some '60s utopian fantasy of the collective. What Cookie's Fortune suggests is that for Altman order in the universe can't be discerned in the comings and goings of lone heroes but in the interactions among vast and disparate collections of people.

This included manpower accounting. We always saw the term and heard it and used it as absent without leave. While we had few or no real instances of AWOL, it was reported daily. The use of WO for without meant--to us, anyway--that a person who was gone, missing, couldn't be found, etc., was absent and had been granted no leave-- official, unofficial, or what have you. This was AWOL . There could be leaves of unofficial nature (often called hip-pocket leave), but those were not reported as any kind of leave: they compensated a person some time off for a job well done or for a long period in action and were not charged against ordinary leave allowances. But being AWOL was a no-no, whether official or unofficial.", "passage_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_1/journal/verbatim/VOL22_2.txt_n-r1252", "passage_index": 2, "label": "option3", "justification": null, "question_id": "oanc_data/OANC-GrAF/data/written_1/journal/verbatim/VOL22_2.txt_n-r1252_plain_2_assignment2994", "worker_id": "worker87", "validation_way": 2, "protocol": "baseline", "start_time": "2020-11-18T15:02:50.348132", "finish_time": "2020-11-18T15:19:27.896078", "delta_sec": 997, "delta_micro_sec": 547946, "option1": "all the leaves were reported as a leave", "option2": "AWOL was not reported as a leave", "option3": "only hip-pocket leaves", "option4": "most of the leaves were not reported", "treatment": 0}
